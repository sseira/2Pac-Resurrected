It goes like this....\nBack when Mark Wallburg was marky mark\nThis is how we used to make the party start\nWe used to...mix hen with bacardi dark\nand when it... kicks in you can hardly talk\nand by the... sixth gin you gon probly crawl\nand you'll be... sick then and you'll probly barf\nand my pre-...diction is that you gon probably fall\neither somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall\nand every-... things spinnin your beginning to\nthink women are swimmin in\npink linen again in the sink\nthen in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished\nyou are now allowed to officially slap bitches\nyou have the right to remain violent and start wildin\nstart a fight with the same guy that was smart eye'n ya\nget in the car and start it and start drivin\nover the island and cause a 42 car pile up\nEarth calling, pilot to co-pilot, looking for life on this\nplanet sir, no sign of it\nAll i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin and\nI'm so high that I might die if i go by it.\nLet me out of this place I'm outta place,\nI'm in in outter space, I've just\nvanished without a trace.\nI'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow,\nI'll be back in an hour or so.\nCuz every time I go to try to leave (whoa-o-o)\nsomeone keeps pullin on my sleeve (whoa-o-o)\nI dont wanna but I gotta stay (whoa-o-o)\nthese drugs really gotta hold on me (whoa-o-o)\nCuz everytime I try ta tell 'em no (no-o-o)\nthey won't let me ever let 'em go (go-o-o)\nI'm a sucker all I gotta say (whoa-o-o)\nthese drug's really gotta hold on me (whoa-o-o)\nIn third grade all I used to do, was sniff glue through a\ntube and play rubixcube\nSeventeen years later I'm as rude as jude\nSchemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs\nI got no game, and every face looks the same\nthey got no name, so i don't need game to play\nI just say whatever I want, to whoever I want,\nwhenever i want, wherever I want, however I want\nHowever I do show some respect to few\nThis ecstacy has got me standin next to you\nGettin sentimental as fuck, spillin guts to you\nWe just met, but I think I'm in love with you\nBut your on it too, so you tell me you love me too,\nWake up in the morning like  What the fuck we do?\nI gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do, Cuz if\nI get caught cheatin then I'm stuck with you\nBut in the long run these drugs are probably gonna\ncatch up sooner or later\nBut fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy,\nlet the ex destroy your spinal chord,\nso it's not a straight line no more\nSo we walk around lookin like some wind-up dolls,\nShit stickin out of ourbacks like a dinosaur,\nShit, six hit's won't even get me high no more,\nso bye for now, I'm gonna try\nto find some more\nChorus\nThat's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow\nwhen you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow\nAnd tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again\nWhat's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it\nand whats a little bit of alcohol poisoning? and whats a little fight,\ntomorrow you'll be boys again\nIt's your life, live it however you wanna\nMarajuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?\nIt don't matter as long as you get where you're goin\nCuz none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin\nThey tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin,\neven though you wake upfeelin like shit every mornin.\nBut you're young, you got a lot of drugs to do,\ngirls to screw, parties tocrash, sucks to be you\nIf I could take it all back now I wouldn't,\nI woulda did more shit thatpeople said that I shouldnt\nBut I'm all grown up now,\nand upgraded and graduated to better drugs and\nupdated\nBut I still gotta a lot of growin up to do,\nI still gotta whole lot ofthrowin up to spew\nBut when it's all said and done\ni'll be forty before i know it wit a 40 on\nthe porch tellin stories\nwith a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap,\nbabysitting for Hailie, while\nHailie's out gettin smashed.\nChorus x 2\ndrugs really gotta hold on

isn't working\nAnd every single person is a Slim Shady lurking\nHe could be working at Burger King spitting on your onion rings\nOr in the parking lot, circling, screaming  I don't give a fuck!\nWith his windows down and his system up\nSo, will the real Shady please stand up?\nAnd put one of those fingers on each hand up?\nAnd be proud to be outta ya mind and outta control\nAnd one more time, loud

regain back\nThe spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap\nTo the same plant\nAnd the same pants\nTryin to chase rap\nGotta move ASAP\nGet a new plan\nMomma's got a new man\nPoor little baby sister, she don't understand\nSits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad\nAnd just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand\nWhile she colors a big brother, a mother and dad\nAin't no telling what really goes on in her little head\nWish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had\nBut I keep running from something I never wanted so bad\nSometimes I get upset cuz I ain't blew up yet\nIt's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet\nDon't got a rep, my step\nDon't got enough pep\nThe pressure's too much, man I'm just tryin to do what's best\nAnd I try\nSit alone and I cry\nYo I won't tell no lie\nNot a moment goes by\nThat I don't pray to the sky\nPlease, I'm beggin you God\nPlease don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job\nYo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are\nYo, I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow\nTell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye\nSay whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far\nBut yo I gotta get out there the only way I know\nAnd I'ma be back for you the second that I blow\nOn everything I own\nI'll make it on my own\nOff to work I go\nBack to this 8 Mile Road\nI'm a man\nGotta make a new

didn't, you wouldn't get it\nOr see what the big deal is\nWhy it was and it still is\nTo be walking this borderline of Detroit's city limits\nIt's different and it's a certain significance\nA certificate of authenticity\nYou'd never even see\nBut it's everything to me\nIt's my credibiiity\nYou'd never seen, heard, smelled or met a real mc\nWho's incredible or on the same pedestal as me\nBut yet still unsigned\nHaving a rough time\nSit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes\nGo to work and serve mc's in the lunch line\nWhen it comes crunch time\nWhere did my punch lines go?\nWho must I show?\nTo bust my flow\nWhere must I go?\nWho must I know?\nOr am I just another crab in the bucket\nCuz I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but fuck it\nMaybe I need a new outlet\nI'm starting to doubt shit\nI'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with\nI live like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit\nAt the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit\nAnd it's cold\nTrying to travel this road\nPlus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode\nMy defenses are so up\nThe one thing I don't want\nIs pity from no one\nThis city is no fun\nThere is no sun\nAnd it's so dark\nSometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart\nFrom each one of my limbs\nBy each one of my friends\nIt's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin\nSometimes I feel like a robot\nSometimes I just know not\nWhat I'm doing, I just blow, my head is a stove top\nI just explode, the kettle gets so hot\nSometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got\nBut I've learned\nIt's time for me to u-turn\nYo it only takes one time for me to get burned\nAin't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl\nI can not only play stupid or be immature\nI got every ingredient all I need is the courage\nLike I already got the beat all I need is the words\nGot the urge\nSuddenly it's a surge\nSuddenly a new burst of energy has occured\nTime to show these free world leaders the three and a third\nI am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird\nThen I turn and cross over the median curb\nHit the burbs and all you see is a blur\nI'm 8 Mile Road\nI'm a man\nGotta make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land\nTime for me to just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back\nAnd I'm gone\nI

plan\nMomma's got a new man\nPoor little baby sister, she don't understand\nSits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad\nAnd just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand\nWhile she colors a big brother, a mother and dad\nAin't no telling what really goes on in her little head\nWish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had\nBut I keep running from something I never wanted so bad\nSometimes I get upset cuz I ain't blew up yet\nIt's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet\nDon't got a rep, my step\nDon't got enough pep\nThe pressure's too much, man I'm just tryin to do what's best\nAnd I try\nSit alone and I cry\nYo I won't tell no lie\nNot a moment goes by\nThat I don't pray to the sky\nPlease, I'm beggin you God\nPlease don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job\nYo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are\nYo, I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow\nTell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye\nSay whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far\nBut yo I gotta get out there the only way I know\nAnd I'ma be back for you the second that I blow\nOn everything I own\nI'll make it on my own\nOff to work I go\nBack to this

it's a certain significance\nA certificate of authenticity\nYou'd never even see\nBut it's everything to me\nIt's my credibiiity\nYou'd never seen, heard, smelled or met a real mc\nWho's incredible or on the same pedestal as me\nBut yet still unsigned\nHaving a rough time\nSit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes\nGo to work and serve mc's in the lunch line\nWhen it comes crunch time\nWhere did my punch lines go?\nWho must I show?\nTo bust my flow\nWhere must I go?\nWho must I know?\nOr am I just another crab in the bucket\nCuz I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but fuck it\nMaybe I need a new outlet\nI'm starting to doubt shit\nI'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with\nI live like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit\nAt the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit\nAnd it's cold\nTrying to travel this road\nPlus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode\nMy defenses are so up\nThe one thing I don't want\nIs pity from no one\nThis city is no fun\nThere is no sun\nAnd it's so dark\nSometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart\nFrom each one of my limbs\nBy each one of my friends\nIt's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin\nSometimes I feel like a robot\nSometimes I just know not\nWhat I'm doing, I just blow, my head is a stove top\nI just explode, the kettle gets so hot\nSometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got\nBut I've learned\nIt's time for me to u-turn\nYo it only takes one time for me to get burned\nAin't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl\nI can not only play stupid or be immature\nI got every ingredient all I need is the courage\nLike I already got the beat all I need is the words\nGot the urge\nSuddenly it's a surge\nSuddenly a new burst of energy has occured\nTime to show these free world leaders the three and a third\nI am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird\nThen I turn and cross over the median curb\nHit the burbs and all you see is a blur\nI'm 8 Mile

and dildos\nYou fucked yourself so much\nYou barely feel those anymore\nYou're only 24 but you're plenty more now.\nSure than those other little hoes\nWho just act like little girls\nLike they're in middle school still\nYou're crazy sexy cool, chillin\nYou play your position\nYou never step out of line\nEven though I stay in your business\nYou've always kept out of mine.\nI wonder whats on your mind\nSometimes they say love is blind\nMaybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye\nYou ain't see a sign.\n[with Chorus]\nOr maybe you did Maybe you like me and stuff\nMaybe cuz we're crazy in loooove\n[Chorus]\nCrazy Over you\nCrazy Over you\nLet me go crazy crazy Over youuuuuuuuu\n[Verse 2]\nYou're the ink to my paper\nWhere my pen is to my pad\nThe moral, the very fiber\nThe whole substance to my rap.\nYou are my reason for being\nThe meaning of my existence\nIf it wasn't for you\nI would never be able to spit this\nThese sentences I do wit me I am me\nIs you rely on me as much\nas I rely on you to inspire me like you do.\nYou provide me the lighterfluid to fuel my fire\nYou're my entire supply\nGas, the match, the igniter.\nThe only way that I am able to stay so stable\nIs you're the legs to my table\nIf you were to break I'd fall on my face.\nBut I'm always going to make you feel\nI don't need you as much as I really need you\nSo you don't use it to your advantage.\nBut you're essential to me\nYou're the air I breathe\nI believe if you ever leave me\nI'd probably have no reason to be.\nYou are the Kim to my Marshall\nYou're the Slim to my Shady\nThe Dre to my Eminem\nThe Elaina to my Hailey.\nYou are the word I am looking for when\nI'm trying to describe how I feel inside\nAnd the right one just won't come to my mind.\nYou're like the pillar that props me up\nThe beam that supports me\nThe bitch who never took half,\nThe wife who never divorced me.\nYou're like the root to my evil\nYou let my devil come out me\nYou let me beat the shit out you\nBefore you beat the shit out me.\n[with Chorus]\nAnd no matter how much\nToo much is never enough\nMaybe cuz we're crazy in loooove\n[Chorus]\nI'm Crazy Over you\nCrazy Over you\nLet me go crazy

we act like 2 maniacs in the sac\nWe fuck like 2 jackrabbits\nAnd maybe that's a bad habit.\nCuz the next day we're right back at it\nIn the same exact pattern\nWhat the fuck is the matter with us\nWe can't figure out if it's\nLust or it's love\nWhat's sad is what's attracting us to each other\nThey say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.\nWhich would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch\nBut I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today\nBut you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you\nJust cuz I came home late last night

heard, smell, or met an MC\nWho's incredible and on the same pedistool as me\nBut check\nStill unsigned\nHavin a rough time\nSit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes\nGo to work\nAnd servin MC's in the lunch line\nBut when it come's crunch time\nWhere do my punch lines go?\nWho must I show?\nTo bust my flow?\nWhere must I go?\nWho must I know?\nOr am I just another crab in the

up\nAnd one thing I don't want\nIs pity from no one\nThe city is no fun\nThere is no sun\nAnd it's so dark\nSometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart\nBeing torn in my limbs\nBy each one of my

search\nSuddenly a new verse of energy has occured\nTime to show these free world leaders\nThree in the third\nI am no longer scared now\nI'm free as a bird\nAnd I turn and cross over\nThe median

father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter\nBut hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water\nThese hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product\nThey moved on to the next shmo' who flows he nose dove, and sold nada\nSo the soap opera's told it unfolds I suppose it's old partner\nBut the beat goes on da da dum da da dum datta\nYou better lose yourself in the music,\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music,\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo\nNo more games, I'ma change what you call rage\nTear this mother fuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged\nI was playin in the beginning, the mood all changed\nI been chewed up, and spit out and booed off stage\nBut I kept rhymin' and step writin' the next cypher\nYou best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper\nAll the pain inside amplified by the, fact that\nI can't get by with my nine to five\nAnd I can't provide the right type'a\nLife for my family 'cause man,\nThese goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers\nAnd it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer,\nThis is my life and these times are so hard\nAnd it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus\nTeetertotter caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna\nBaby mama drama's screamin' on and\nToo much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another jam or not\nHas gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got\nTo formulate a plot 'fore I end up in jail or shot\nSuccess is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not\nMom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go\nI cannot grow old in Salem's lot,\nSo here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not\nThis maybe the only opportunity that I got\nYou better lose yourself in the music,\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music,\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo\nYou can do anything you set your mind to man.\n", "title": "Fat Joe lyrics"},

whole Mediterranean,\nIsn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian,\nNo, it's Dave Raymond and oh,\nOh sorry, yo, so sorry, whoa\nBut that was a long time ago,\nWhen I was just Joe Schmo,\nRapping in Joe Blow's basement,\nI apologized for it before so,\nEither accept it or you don't,\nAnd let's move on,\nIf I ain't shown that I've grown you can get the bone,\nKeep lickin these nuts you industry mutts,\nKeep walking around sniffing each other's butts,\nOr should I say asses,\nWhat would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses,\nThe question I ask is how can I explain this,\nHow can I swing this in English language,\nIf I switched to slang and turned man to mane,\nDo I do it in vain or simply to entertain,\nAm I being real or am I being fake,\nAm I just a fraud or am I truly genuine,\nOr am I caught up in this hot water,\nWord on my daughter,\nI told you That I love this culture,\nDon't let 'em insult ya,\nI'ma tell you once more again\nThis is the environment I was brought up in,\nBut every now and then,\nI use my pen to get rid of some frustration,\nOr should I say ?shun?,\nIs it just another one of my subliminal ways erases em?,\nYour face is numb, you're stunned,\nYou look is cold like that of a man that's 70 something years old,\nAnd it only gets colder,\nWhich is why I understand,\nYou can't be mad at a 44 year old fan with a chip on his shoulder,\nWho only owns a half of a magazine,\nAnd the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again,\nOnly thing that makes them grin is to see me frown,\nPapa can't stand me,\nPapa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down,\nIn his new chair that goes round and round,\nThat he bought from the money in his bank account,\nThat I get him every issue when the thing comes out,\nSit back and let his puffy clown hair come out,\nAnd let his black side arm wrestle his white side,\nYellow par tied odd enough that he might slide,\nHe might find someone dumb enough that they might ride,\nBut ain't nobody over buying two white guys,\nDisguised as pro-black,\nThere is no slack for a Hartford college grat in a fitted hat,\nAnd a hunchback standin by the clearance coat rack,\nIn some old slacks and some RSO throwbacks,\nShady in the place to bc,\nAnd it takes what I got to rock the mike,\nStill not gonna cater these punks,\nFuckin cock-suckin, pussy-lipped, hated, mixed, cunts.\n", "title": "Freestyle (Dissin' The Source) lyrics"}, {"lyrics": "Eminem:\nIf I'm elected for ten terms\nI'm renewing the staff after the inagural\nAnd hiring all girls as interns\nIf I

emotions run deep as oceans exploding\nTempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep going\nNot taking nothing from no one, give em hell long as I'm breathing\nKeep kicking ass in the morning, and taking names in the evening\nLeave them with a taste sour as vinegar in they mouth\nSee they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out\nLook at me now, I betcha prolly sick of me now\nAin't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now\nChorus x2\nI'm sorry mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant make you cry\nBut tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet\nOne More Time\nI'm

before they throw me inside my coffin and close it\nI'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73\nBefore I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD\nI was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months\nMy faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch\n'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye\nNo I don't, on second thought I just fucking wished he would die\nI look at Hailey, and I couldn't picture leaving her side\nEven if I hated Kim, I grin my teeth and I try to make it work\nWith her atleast for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes\nBut I'm only human but I'm man enough to face them today\nWhat I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb\nBut the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun\nCause I'd of killed em, shit I would've shot Kim and him both\nIt's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show\nChorus x2\nVerse #3\nNow I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition\nTake a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing\nBut put yourself in my position, just try to envision\nWitnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen\nBitching that someone's always going through her purse when shit's missing\nGoing through public housing systems, victim of munchhausen syndrome\nMy whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't\n'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?\nWasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?\nSo you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?\nBut guess what, your getting older now and it's cold when your lonely\nAnd Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that your phoney\nAnd Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful\nBut you'll never see her, she wont even be at your funeral *hahaha*\nSee what hurts me the most, is you wont admit you was wrong\nBitch, do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mum\nBut how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get\nYou selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit!\nRemember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?\nWell guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be\nChorus x2\n",

contamination\nExamination of more cartoons than animation\nMy lamination of narration\nHit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation\nWhen I declare invasion, there ain't no time to

That's what I'm talking about\nMother fucker just trying to get his pussy\n[Verse 2:]\nI used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments\nI used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense\nUntil the day I started following your feetprints\nAnd tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents\nIt made complete sense, there's someone else you like\nSo I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?\nAnd you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga**\nSomeone rich that I could follow\nAnd you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow\nLeaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted\nI fell apart when you departed then the joking started\nI was an open target, you play comedian\nAnd I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again\nAnd so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife\nAll in my sex life, I got a message from Phife\nHe goes, \"You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now\"\nTake a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down\nYou run me down and now your trying to apologize\nFor all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes\nBecause I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it\nJealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...\n[Chorus: Men Singing]\nJealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (12X)\n", "title": "Jealousy Woes II lyrics"}, {"lyrics": "if you had one shot one opportunity\nto fight for your country will you fight\nor will you go down with no honor\noh his palms are sweaty\nguns slippen all ready\nthere nervous but on the surface\nthey look calm and ready to drop bombs\nWhile looken at the flag\nthe whole land goes so loud\neverybody openthere ears right now to go check it out but\nclock\u2019s run out times up over blow\nsnap back to reality op there goes everybody\nthey now there whole life is on the line\nbut it don\u2019t matter\nthe front line goes to the ground\nthey now there going so down\neverybody is screaming now\nso the better go capture this moment\nand go kill every man they got\n", "title": "Jet Remix lyrics"}, {"lyrics": "(eminem)Yo Yo\nJingle bells jingle bells.\nJingling all the way\nOh what it is to ride from Detroit to east LA\n(Eminem)\nIs this a white Christmas hell no my man\nImp leaving blood in the snow and smacking\nFat man.

Eminem\nI'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone\nI'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone\nI'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason\nI'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin\nFlavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview\nI'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review\nI'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals\nThis is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols\nBut I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles\nSlim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)\nExtortion, snortin, supportin abortion\nPathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion\nThe looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic\nImpulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict\nHalf animal, half man\nDumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can\nWith more holes than an Afghan\nChorus\nVerse Three: Eminem\nSomebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)\nI'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine\nI'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin\nClinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion\nFuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure\nI'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher\nI can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches\nSick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes\nIn school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush\nDoin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush\nThen I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed\nWent to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team\nDon't take me for a joke I'm no comedian\nToo many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again\nI'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median\nFinally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in\nChorus\nOutro: Eminem\nHey, fuck that!\nOutsidaz..\nPace One..\nYoung Zee..\n", "title": "Mommy lyrics"}, {"album": "Album: Straight From The Lab EP", "lyrics":

I take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've\nMorphed into an immortal coming through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows\nYou're like normal, fuck being normal\nAnd I just bought a new Raygun from the future\nTo just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad\nSingin' to a man while they played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\n\"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you\"\nLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)\nUh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\nSo that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you\nI'm never stating, more than never demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating\nCause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\nOh, he's too mainstream\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\nIt's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it\nI don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to,\nProve that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!\nSchool flunkie, pill junky\nBut look at the accolades the skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\nBut it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat\nBumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils, here's what they want from me\nThey asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\nBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon't mistake it for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\nAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\nBe a king?

the man\nPlus a luxury sedan\nToo comfortable and roomy in a six\nThey threw me in the mix\nWith all these gloomy lunatics\nWalk around depressed\nAnd smoke a pound of ses a day\nAnd yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today\nMy daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play\nLive half my life and throw the rest away\nChorus\nThere's people that love me and people that hate me\nBut it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady\nI want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame\nThat Means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames\nThat means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name\nLifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain\nRight now I feel like just hit the rock bottom\nI got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em\nI'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em\nHolding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em\nMy daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em\nAnd them rings you wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em\nAnd while you flaunting them I could be taking them to shops to pawn them\nI got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?\nCause I never

dime you have, they want you to lose your mind\nevery time you mad\nSo they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon\nAny dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns\nThat's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off\nof these streets quickly\nBut all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while\npolice fingerprint me\nThey're for the

it to my brain, scream \"Die Shady!\" and pop it\nThe sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was\nSupposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes\nThat's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'\nIt's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk up to Kim and kiss her\nTell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister\nAlmost as if to
