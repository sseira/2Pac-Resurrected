before six\nAnd after that it's all bricks\nA fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight\nAnd my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam\nI skate with the bomb\nI'm asking you don't play with me at all\nShots hit your ass and make three of y'all\nIt'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints\nCuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit\nFit for two clips\nThe kid is a
