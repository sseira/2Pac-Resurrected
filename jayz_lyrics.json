Metropolis\nMy name is like a square\nDropped off every tier\nNow y'all can swear to Jay\nHeard it the other day\nThrough the mystery, we get it swiftly\nWe got to hit you every night before we hit the lights it's type addictive\nNeed cats to live with, the heat goes on\nEveryday is a hustle, the beat goes on\nFunny thing happen, in the midst of chasing money and foes\nAnd the worst thing worst then getting old is not getting old\nNiggaz stay low, like six bowls of shit and gold\nAnd watch the hoes when they bump into your clothes\nAnd I hope they shine\nSeen a lot of things and enough

something\nWhen I get home\nThen it's on\nGirl just crack those shaped legs like Grade A eggs\nLove the way you behave and beg\nMoan, turn those hollers to screams as we zone like a college team\nThen they can hear you from Hollis, Queens (226)\nLife with me, consists of a lot of things\nChips in your ear hit the dirt 'cause you got hotter things\nBut you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness\nRemind them freak chicks to stay out my business\nYou know they can't love it, trips to LA with no luggage\nCame back with six bags struggling\nIn first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me\nBank still off on me\nChorus #2: (Singing)\nBut until the last day, I'm the one who's crazy\n'Cause that's the way you making me feel (can't knock the hustle)\nI don't want no romance, I just want the chance\nCan't knock the hustle for real\nVerse Three\nEver since you retired, working alongside those live wires\nBeen in this rap biz with fake nigs you know liars\nI guess I'm biased, what I talk about I live\nThese rap dudes can flip, but some of them ain't even rhyming for chips\nWHAT PART OF THE GAME IS THIS\nSeems brainless, on tours with whores that's what I'm saying I miss\nCats that go all out for their gold plaques\nStarting out with four jacks, ended up with Gold Ac's\nBet your love collapses if my funds get trapped\nOn the weight of me through you, screw you\nGun blew you, I didn't want to choose you\nRun through you like UH, EXCUSE YOU!\nBut that's my cash, I understand you hustle\nThat's my cash, you don't understand\nLet my dough flash, you

together\nBut like all good things, we must come to an end\nPlease show the same love to my friends\nDear Summer\n", "title": "Dear Summer lyrics"}, {"album": "Album: The Black Album", "lyrics": "[Jay-Z's Mom:]\nSean Carter was born December 4th\nWeighing in at 10 pounds 8 ounces\nHe was the last of my 4 children\nThe only one who didn't give me any pain when i gave birth to him\nAnd that's how i knew that he was a special child\n[Jay-Z Verse 1]\nThey say \"they never really miss you til you dead or you gone\"\nSo on that note i'm leaving after the song\nSo you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long\nAtleast let me tell you why i'm this way, Hold on\nI was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adaness Revees\nWho made love under the Siccamore tree\nWhich makes me\nA more sicker M.C. and my momma would claim\nAt 10 pounds when i was born i didn't give her no pain\nAlthough through the years i gave her her fair share\nI gave her her first real scare\nI made it from birth and i got here\nShe knows my purpose wasn't purpose\nI ain't perfect i care\nBut i feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear\nNow i'm just scratchin the surface cause what's burried under there\nWas a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared\nI went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted\nBut i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted\nHold on\n[Jay-Z's Mom:]\nShawn was a very shy child growing up\nHe was into sports\nAnd a funny story is\nAt 4 he taught hisself how to ride a bike\nA two wheeler at that\nIsn't that special?\nBut, i noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up\n[Jay-Z Verse 2]\nNow all the teachers couldn't reach me\nAnd my momma couldn't beat me\nHard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me, SO\nWith that distain in my membrain\nGot on my pimp game\nFuck the world my defense came\nThen Dahaven introuced me to the game\nSpanish Jose introduced me to cane\nI'm a hustler now\nMy gear is in and i'm in the in crowd\nAnd all the wavey light skinned girls is lovin me now\nMy self esteem went through the roof man i got my swag\nGot a volvo from this girl when her man got bagged\nPlus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had\nSupposedly knowin nobody paid Jaz wack ass\nI'm geting ahead of myself, by the way, i could rap\nThat came second to me movin this crack\nGimme a second i swear\nI will say about my rap career\nTil 96 came niggas i'm here\nGood-bye\n[Jay-Z's Mom:]\nShawn use to be in the kitchen\nBeating on the table and rapping\nAnd um, until the wee hours of the morning\nAnd then i bought him a boom box\nAnd his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts\nBut that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble\n[Jay-Z Verse 3]\nGood-bye to the game all the spoils, the adreneline rush\nYour blood boils you in a spot knowing cops could rush\nAnd you in a drop your so easy to touch\nNo two days are alike\nExcept the first and fifteenth pretty much\nAnd \"trust\" is a word you seldom hear from us\nHustlers we don't sleep we rest one eye up\nAnd the drought to find a man when the well dries up\nYou learn to work the water without workin thirst til die YUP\nAnd niggas get tied up for product\nAnd little brothers ring fingers get cut up\nTo show mothers they really got em\nAnd this was the stress i live with til i decided\nTo try this rap shit for a livin\nI Pray i'm forgiven\nFor every bad decision i made\nEvery sister i played\nCause i'm still paranoid to this day\nAnd it's nobody fault i made the decisions i made\nThis is the life i chose or rather the life that chose me\nIf you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when i fade to black\nIf you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when i fade to black\n[repeat 2 more times to fade]\n", "title": "December 4th lyrics"}, {"lyrics": "\u00d4 menina deixa disso quero te conhecer,\nv\u00ea se me da uma chance to afim de

Lucky Me\n[Chorus: Karen Anderson, Jay-Z]\nYou only know what you see,\nYou dont understand what it takes to be me\nYou only know what you see,\n(Since I was 4 years old, I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold)\nYou dont understand what it takes to be me\n(And now that I've arrived\nI see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold)\nNigga see you in the street, pretend to be friendly\nBut I know any type of success breeds envy\nI know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me\nLeave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny\nBut G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive\nAnything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up\nAnd ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up\nDont grieve for me my art remains\nlike a dart from the speaker to your heart\nSpiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal\nPlan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life\nThough I can't see past the girls greed to call her wife\nNext time your thinking heist better be precise\nCause I'm fully prepared. One of us is gon' leave here\nI have no regrets even though I wanna see grow\nMy godsons Boogie, Sonny and Rimo\n[Chorus x 4]\n", "title": "Lucky Me lyrics"}, {"album": "Album: The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse", "lyrics": "(feat.
