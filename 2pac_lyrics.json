out my business\nVerse One: 2Pac\nPerhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back\nI couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats\nWill I, succeed, paranoid from the weed\nAnd hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see\nAnd in my mind I'ma blind man doin time\nLook to my future cause my past, is all behind me\nIs it a crime, to fight, for what is mine\nEverybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin\nI've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed\nAnd fantasies of my family, in a hearse\nAnd they say it's the white man I should fear\nBut, it's my own kind doin all the killin here\nI can't lie, ain't no love for the other side\nJealousy inside, make em wish I died\nOh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin for\nEverybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door\nAnd all my memories, of seein brothers bleed\nAnd everybody grieves, but still nobody sees\nRecollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix\nCause the media is full of dirty tricks\nOnly

to'em\nThey tested, it was stressed that they under\nIn our days, things changed\nEveryone's ashamed to the youth cuz the truth looks strange\nAnd for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts\ncause any day they'll push the button\nand yall condemned like Malcolm x and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin\nDon't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary\nbut when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly\nthere's no need for you to fear me\nif you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me\nit aint about black or white, cuz we're human\nI hope we see the light before its ruined\nmy ghetto gospel\n[Chorus - Elton John]\n[2Pac]\nTell me do you see that old lady aint it sad\nLiving out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has\nAnd over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy\nGuess she's given birth to a baby\nI don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan\nWe jump into another form of slavery\nEven now I keep discouraged\nWonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage\nI refuse to be a role model\nI set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle\nI make mistakes, I learn from everyone\nAnd when its said and done\nI bet this Brotha be a better one\nIf I'm upset, you don't stress\nNever forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet\nI feel his hand on my brain\nWhen I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang\nBut am I less holy\nCuz I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies\nBefore we find world peace\nWe gotta find peace in that war on the streets\nMy ghetto

marks\nAnd the punk police can't fade me, and maybe\nWe can have peace someday G\nBut right now I got my mind set up\nLookin down the barrel of my nine, get up\nCause it's time to make the payback fat\nTo my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black\nAnd accept no substitutes\nI bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school\nOh no, I won't turn the other cheek\nIn case ya can't see us while we burn the other week\nNow we got him in a smash, blast\nHow long will it last 'til the po' gettin mo' cash\nUntil then, raise up!\nTell my young black males, blaze up!\nLife's a mess don't stress, test\nI'm givin but be thankful that you're livin, blessed\nMuch love to my brothers in the pen\nSee ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in\nOnce again it's an all out scrap\nKeep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back\nCause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya\nMess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya\nScream, if ya feel me; see it

Two]\nPump ya fists like this\nHolla if ya hear me - PUMP PUMP if you're pissed\nTo the sell-outs, livin it up\nOne way or another you'll be givin it up, huh\nI guess cause I'm black born\nI'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on\nBut it's time for a new plan, BAM!\nI'll be swingin like a one man, clan\nHere we go, turn it up, don't stop\nTo my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops\nI'm still around for ya\nKeepin my sound underground for ya\nAnd I'ma throw a change up\nQuayle, like you never brought my name up\nNow my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets\nThey fell me when they rollin in they fat jeeps\nThis ain't just a rap song, a black song\nTellin all my brothers, get they strap on\nAnd look for me in the struggle\nHustlin 'til other

still I keep\nrepresentin, never give up, on a good thing\nWouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing\nAnd now I'm like a major threat\nCause I remind you of the things you were made to forget\nBring the noise, to all my boyz\nKnow the real from the bustas and the decoys\nAnd if ya hustle like a real G\nPump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me\nLearn to survive in the nine-tre'\nI make rhyme pay, others make crime pay\nWhatever it takes to live and stand\nCause nobody else'll give a damn\nSo we live like caged beasts\nWaitin for the day to let the rage free\nStill

lot for a little romance\nGot to my car, put the key in the ignition\nturned on the slow jams, I was on a mission\nI was catchin' wild things like the chicken pox\nI was \"J\" and knockin' boots right down the socks\nShe was freaky and wild, oh man could I call it?\nBut when I dropped her off, she had stole my wallet\nI couldn't quite believe that why a hoocher-coocher?\nBut that was my first experience with MINNIE THE MOOCHER!!\n(2Pac)\nMinnie the Moocher was a legend on the block I'm from\nA dream girl to many brothers, but true to none\nHer reputation was enormous - a real go getter\nAnd once a brother met her, he wanted to get with her\nMaybe it was her smile, her personality or\nthe way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore\nBut whatever it was, Minnie the Moocher was an expert\nReal heart-breaker, but never get hurt\nShe had this boyfriend, his name was Diamond\nhelpin' Minnie out with the little social climbin'\nMet with Politicians, peace to many others\nSuddenly and instantly, they became her lovers\nShe took the power that they possessed\nAnd Minnie did it all without gettin' undressed\nMinnie dissed Diamond sayin' that he could not live with her\nBut he wanted payment for the things he did for her\nHe grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand\nMinnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right hand\nShe was a legend to everyone who knew her\nThat's is my memory of Minnie the Moocher\n(Ray Tyson)\nMinnie had a boyfriend, a gambler\nAddicted to poker, an alcoholic, a basshead, crack smoker\nHe took her to Harlem, and all around Chinatown\nHe bought some bass, a pipe a tape of hard-rap sounds\nShe was an addict, tired of the static and poverty\nSick of the same ghetto misery\nSee, Minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement\nSmokey was a hoodlum, headin' for inditement\nThen one day their relationship stopped\nwhen Smokey was killed by the M-I-C-Cops\nMinnie was hurt, lost without a clue\nTo her, there was no chance of gettin' somebody new\nSo she walked home sadly, as bad as it seems\nShe cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams\n(Ray Tyson)\nShe had dreams and schemes about the King of Sweden\nHe gave her things that this girl was much needin'\nA plush house made of gold and steel\nA diamond car with a platt in the wheel\nNow you might think this is a lot of stuff\nBut to Minnie this was not enough\nHe bought a stable, full of thorough-bred race horses\nHis meal she ate was a dozen courses\nShe had a fortune in nickels and dimes\nAnd she sat around and counted it a billion times\nShe had bank, yeah Minnie was clockin'\nHad every sucker in the neighborhood JOCKIN'!!\nShe would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye\nThen she dissin', with zero reply\n", "title": "Minnie The
